#  Zoho Email Extractor â€“ by Sysdevcode

This is a simple but powerful Python tool that extracts **email contacts, sender names, subjects, timestamps, and attachments** from your **Zoho Mail inbox** and saves everything into Excel, CSV, and JSON formats â€” with analytics included.

We built this because our small startup, **Sysdevcode (Kerala, India)**, got over **1000 internship applications** via Zoho Mail â€” and we had no auto-reply, no filters, and no plan for follow-ups.  
So, instead of depending on expensive automation tools, we built our own. Now itâ€™s open-source ðŸ’š

##  Why we created this

After posting an internship poster, we received 1000+ resumes on Zoho Mail.  
But we forgot to set any autoresponders or filters ðŸ˜…

We looked for tools â†’ Most were paid or didnâ€™t fit.  
We asked AI â†’ It helped, but the logic wasnâ€™t perfect.  
So we decided to code our own tool from scratch.

Now it's working perfectly â€” and open to anyone who wants to use, fork, or contribute.
